Namaste!

I am a hobbyist coder.

I dabble in C++, python and bash scripts. I work moderately well with excel VBA scripts and SPSS syntax. I also did some php, HTML, CSS & js. I learnt all of these with one basic motivation: automation of redundant tasks (because laziness, of course).

In the avatar, I am perched on top of the A-block hostel of my undergrad years, looking towards the Yellow Building/ Kanti Bal, sometime around 2007. So the hair.
